# chatroom
Basic chatroom implemented in Node.js. WIP! The purpose of this code is to finally learn Node.js and be comfortable using it for general applications.

Finally got the demo working after trial and error, was an issue with the client pulling socket.io correctly

TODO:

  Add unique usernames

  Add chat history

  Save chat history to a file periodically

  Possibly allow users to set their username
